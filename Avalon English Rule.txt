At the start of the game, King tokenðŸ‘‘ will be randomly assigned to a player and the King may choose who can complete the current quest.
After the king has done the assignment, any player may vote approve or reject to the assignment. Then, the approve and reject will be counted.

If the reject count is half or more the count of the players, then the quest is rejected, and the king tokenðŸ‘‘ will be given to the next player (next to the King)
If the approve count is more than half players' count, then the quest is executed by the assignees.

When executing a quest, evil players may choose to fail the quest and this will be done secretly. In general, if at least 1 player give the FAIL to that quest, it means that quest will FAIL.

And to prevent each quest being rejected over and over, each quest has maximum reject of 5. If the quest is rejected 5 times, it will automatically FAIL

In a game 8 players or more, lady of the lakeðŸ‘© can be used. Lady of The Lake will give a large benefit for a good forces.. A player who hold the lady token may choose a player to know his/her true identity (good or evil) but only the lady holder knows the truth.
